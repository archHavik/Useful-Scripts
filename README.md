## Welcome!

This repo contains scripts built for a certain competition which will not be named (so other teams don't find these scripts while web scraping). Windows hardening scripts are in windows-hardening. The copy-paster script is for typing stuff to the screen when access to copy and paste is limited(such as in a virtual machine). The windows-other folder contains other scripts that useful for windows such as changing the login banner, automatically opening certain ports for the kfsensor honeypot, etc.
